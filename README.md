# wavy_letters_text

A special text widget which applies an animated offset effect to each individual letter to create a "wavy" or "wobbly" text effect. The aim is to create a good deal of customization to this widget i.e. "wavy" (synchronized) vs "wobbly" (randomized) motion, offset distance of the effect, speed, etc.

Open to contributions.
